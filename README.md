# diabetes-occurrences-prediction

#### Travaux d'initiative personnelles encadr√©s (TIPE)

This is a personal project that I did during my 2nd undergraduate year. 

The objective of the project is to predict the occurrences of diabetes in patients.
To do it, I used both logistic regression and neural networks with differents hyperparameters. 
Another constraint and objective of the project was not to use machine learning libraries like scikit-learn for example.
I used only numpy to do matrix calculation.
So, I reimplemented for example for the neural networks the forward and backward propagation such as the gradient descent.
