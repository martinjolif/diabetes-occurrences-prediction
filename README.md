# diabetes-occurrences-prediction

#### Travaux d'initiative personnelles encadr√©s (TIPE)

This is a personal project I did during my 2nd undergraduate year. At that time, I just focused on accuracy 
 but today I would also consider precision and recall.

The objective of the project is to predict the occurrences of diabetes in patients.
To do it, I used both logistic regression and neural networks with differents hyperparameters. 
Another constraint and objective of the project was not to use machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.
I only used numpy for matrix computations and I reimplemented for example for the neural networks the forward and backward propagation as well as the gradient descent.
